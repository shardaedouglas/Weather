Variable Definitions:

       ID: 11 digit identifier, digits 1-3=Country Code, digits 4-8 represent
           the WMO id if the station is a WMO station.  It is a WMO station if
           digits 9-11="000".

       LATITUDE: latitude of station in decimal degrees

       LONGITUDE: longitude of station in decimal degrees

       STELEV: is the station elevation in meters. -999.0 = missing.

       NAME: station name

       GRELEV: station elevation in meters estimated from gridded digital
               terrain data

       POPCLS: population class 
               (U=Urban (>50,000 persons)); 
               (S=Suburban (>=10,000 and <= 50,000 persons));
               (R=Rural (<10,000 persons))
               City and town boundaries are determined from location of station
               on Operational Navigation Charts with a scale of 1 to 1,000,000.
               For cities > 100,000 persons, population data were provided by
               the United Nations Demographic Yearbook. For smaller cities and
               towns several atlases were uses to determine population.

       POPSIZ: the population of the city or town the station is location in
               (expressed in thousands of persons).

       TOPO: type of topography in the environment surrounding the station,
             (Flat-FL,Hilly-HI,Mountain Top-MT,Mountainous Valley-MV).

       STVEG: type of vegetation in environment of station if station is Rural
              and when it is indicated on the Operational Navigation Chart
              (Desert-DE,Forested-FO,Ice-IC,Marsh-MA).

       STLOC: indicates whether station is near lake or ocean (<= 30 km of 
              ocean-CO, adjacent to a lake at least 25 square km-LA).

       OCNDIS: distance to nearest ocean/lake from station (km).
 
       AIRSTN: airport station indicator (A=station at an airport).

       TOWNDIS: distance from airport to center of associated city or town (km).

       GRVEG: vegetation type at nearest 0.5 deg x 0.5 deg gridded data point of
              vegetation dataset (44 total classifications).
